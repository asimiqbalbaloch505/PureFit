  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

  <p>
    At <strong>PureFit</strong>, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it.
    This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you visit our website.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    PureFit is a static fitness blog. We do not require users to register and we do not
    intentionally collect personal information such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers.
  </p>

  <h2>Log Files & Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    Like many websites, PureFit may use basic analytics or server log files.
    These may include IP address, browser type, device information, date/time,
    and referring pages. This data is used only to improve website performance and user experience.
  </p>

  <h2>Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    PureFit may use cookies to store user preferences or display relevant content and advertisements.
    You can disable cookies through your browser settings if you prefer.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We may use third-party services such as analytics tools or advertising partners.
    These services may use cookies or similar technologies in accordance with their own privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>GDPR & Data Protection Rights</h2>
  <p>
    If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have the right to access,
    correct, or request deletion of your personal data. Since we do not actively collect
    personal data, these rights generally do not apply directly on PureFit.

    PureFit does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.
  </p>

  <h2>Consent</h2>
